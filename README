Introduction
-----------------------------
This README describes some details of program 'cspsol'. Program 'cspsol'
solves cutting stock problems and also bin packing problems. 

-----------------------------
Problem Definition
-----------------------------

"Imagine that you work in a paper mill, and you are a manager in the 
paper cutting division. You have a number of rolls of paper of fixed 
width waiting to be cut, yet different manufacturers want different numbers 
of rolls of various-sized widths. How are you going to cut the rolls so that 
the least amount of left-overs are wasted? This turns out to be an 
optimization problem, or more specifically, an integer linear programming 
problem."

Important node: Right now program minimizes number of rolls used. In other
words, objective function is to minimize total number of rolls required to 
satisfy the demand. Other possible objective could be to minimize total 
amount of left over in each pattern.

-----------------------------
Solution
-----------------------------
Program 'cspsol' uses column generation (CG) technique and branch & 
bound (BB) algorithm. Best pattern/column is generated by solving 
sub-problem (which is integer knapsack problem). 
After solving the  node lp using CG, if solution contains fractional 
variables then simple branching is used to create child nodes while 
becomes part of BB  tree.  Program stops when tree is exhausted/empty.

-----------------------------
Usage
-----------------------------
Following section describes usage of the program.
Usage: cspsol [options...] --data filename

Where filename contains orders data in following format.
max_pattern_width
order_width_1 demand_1
order_width_2 demand_2
order_width_n demand_n

All order widths must be <= max_pattern_width.
All demands, order widths and max_pattern_width must be INTEGERs.
