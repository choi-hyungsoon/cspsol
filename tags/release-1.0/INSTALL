Compiling and Installing program cspsol.
-----------------------------------------------

Package Dependancies
---------------------------------

1. Program cspsol depends on GLPK library. Before compiling, please install 
glpk-4.x. For glpk details see GLPK webpage <http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html>.


Unpacking the distribution file
---------------------------------
The cspsol package is distributed in the form of a packed archive. 
It is one file named `cspsol-X.Y.tar.gz', where `X' is the major version 
number and `Y' is the minor version number.

In order to prepare the distribution for installation you should:

1. Copy the cspsol distribution file to a working directory.

2. Unpack the distribution file with the following command:

        gzip -xvzf cspsol-X.Y.tar.gz

   It automatically creates the subdirectory `cspsol-X.Y' containing the 
   cspsol distribution.


Compiling/Building Executable
-------------------------------- 
1. Go to directory 'cspsol-X.Y/src'. Type make or make cspsol. This should 
compile and build executable 'cspsol'.

        make cspsol

2. Copy/install the executable file 'cspsol' to suitable directory.
