-----------------------------
Introduction
-----------------------------
This README describes some details of program 'cspsol'. Program 'cspsol'
solves cutting stock problem (a.k.a bin packing problem). 

-----------------------------
Problem Definition
-----------------------------
For problem definition see webpage: 
http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/CaseStudies/cutting/index.html

"Imagine that you work in a paper mill, and you are a manager in the 
paper cutting division. You have a number of rolls of paper of fixed 
width waiting to be cut, yet different manufacturers want different numbers 
of rolls of various-sized widths. How are you going to cut the rolls so that 
the least amount of left-overs are wasted? This turns out to be an 
optimization problem, or more specifically, an integer linear programming 
problem."

Important node: Right now program minimizes number of rolls used. In other
words objective functio is to minimize total number of rolls required to 
satisfy the demand. Other possible objective could be to minimize total 
amount of left over in each pattern.

-----------------------------
Solution
-----------------------------
Program 'cspsol' uses column generation technique and branch & bound (BB) algorithm.
Patterns/columns are generated by solving subproblem (which is integer knapsack 
problem). After solving the node lp, if solution contains fractional variables 
then simple branching is used to create child nodes while becomes part of BB 
tree. Program stops after tree is exhausted.


-----------------------------
Usage
-----------------------------
Following section describes usage of the program.

Usage: cspsol filename

Where filename contains orders data in following format.
maximum_pattern_width
order_width_1 demand_1
order_width_2 demand_2
order_width_n demand_n

All demand quantities are <= maximum_pattern_width.
